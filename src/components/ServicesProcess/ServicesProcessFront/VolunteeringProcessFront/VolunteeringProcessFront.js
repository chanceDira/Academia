                <h3>About Volunteering </h3>
            
                <p>
                    By choosing the volunteering abroad, you strengthen your personality and develop enormously during this time. You meet new and very different people and get involved with them. By being a volunteer  you can strengthen your independence and your self-confidence. 
                    There are many advantages for  people who want to do a voluntary service. Above all, you can get a taste of various social professions during the volunteering period, gain a lot of experience and, in the best case, find your dream job. 
                    A basic idea of volunteering is the intercultural exchange. Through direct contact with the population, as a volunteer you will develop an awareness on specific sociatal challenges. 
                    You work in social  or youth facilities or other social projects. In contrast to the development service, a voluntary service abroad does not require completed professional training, but only a lot of motivation for social commitment abroad 
                    We guide you to find an volunteering place  that matchs your personality.
